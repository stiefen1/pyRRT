# RRT / RRT*
![rrt_star_traj_example](fig/rrt_star_traj_example.png)

Python implementation of the RRT* algorithm, with usage example that allows to vizualize the algorithm's searching steps. The current implementation allows to create 2D environment with rectangular and circular obstacles between the current and target positions. 
To install, simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and launch either the `usage/usage.py` or `RRT.py` file. 
A small Matlab implementation is also provided and can simply be launched by running the matlab/RRT.m file.
